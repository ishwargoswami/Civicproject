## üéØ Overview

The WhatsApp notification system allows:
- **Officials** to automatically notify all citizens when they create events
- **Citizens** to receive event notifications, issue updates, and system alerts via WhatsApp
- **Phone verification** via WhatsApp OTP to ensure valid numbers
- **Customizable preferences** for different notification types

### How It Works
1. Citizen adds their phone number in Profile Settings
2. Citizen verifies their number via WhatsApp OTP in Notification Preferences
3. Citizen customizes which notifications they want to receive
4. When an official creates an event, all verified citizens receive a WhatsApp message
5. Citizens can enable/disable or customize notifications anytime

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- A Twilio account (free trial available)
- Python 3.8+ with Django installed
- Node.js 18+ for the frontend
- A WhatsApp-enabled phone number for testing

---

## üöÄ Twilio Setup

### Step 1: Create a Twilio Account

1. Go to [https://www.twilio.com/](https://www.twilio.com/)
2. Click "Sign up" and create a free account
3. Verify your email and phone number

### Step 2: Get Your Credentials

1. From your Twilio Console Dashboard, find:
   - **Account SID** (e.g., `ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
   - **Auth Token** (click the eye icon to reveal)
2. Copy these values - you'll need them for configuration

### Step 3: Set Up WhatsApp Sandbox (For Testing)

For testing, Twilio provides a WhatsApp Sandbox:

1. In the Twilio Console, go to **Messaging** ‚Üí **Try it out** ‚Üí **Send a WhatsApp message**
2. You'll see a WhatsApp sandbox number like `+1 415 523 8886`
3. Follow the instructions to join the sandbox by:
   - Sending a WhatsApp message from your phone to the sandbox number
   - Sending the join code (e.g., "join correct-president")
4. Once joined, this number can receive test messages

### Step 4: Upgrade to Production (Optional)

For production use with real users:

1. Go to **Messaging** ‚Üí **Senders** ‚Üí **WhatsApp senders**
2. Click "Request to enable my WhatsApp number"
3. Complete the Facebook Business Manager verification process
4. Submit your message templates for approval
5. Once approved, you'll get your own WhatsApp Business number

**Note**: The sandbox is perfect for testing! You can have up to 5 test numbers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Configuration

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `twilio==9.0.4` package is already in requirements.txt.

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Create or edit your `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```env
# Twilio WhatsApp Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=+14155238886
```

**Important Notes:**
- For sandbox testing, use `+14155238886` (or your assigned sandbox number)
- For production, use your approved WhatsApp Business number
- DO NOT include "whatsapp:" prefix in the number (the code adds it automatically)

### Step 3: Run Migrations

```bash
cd backend
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

This will add the `metadata` field to the User model if needed.

### Step 4: Start the Django Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

       code="123456"
   )

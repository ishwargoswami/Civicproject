    total_points=Sum('points_earned')
)
```

**Track redemptions:**
```python
from accounts.gamification_models import CommunityCredit

award_points(issue.reporter, 'issue_resolved', 'Issue resolved by officials')
```

```python
# backend/forum/views.py
from accounts.gamification_views import award_points

# When post is created
award_points(request.user, 'forum_post', 'Created forum discussion')

# When comment is added
award_points(request.user, 'forum_comment', 'Commented on discussion')
```

### Events Module
```python
# backend/events/views.py
from accounts.gamification_views import award_points

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Profile not appearing
1. Check if gamification data is set up:
```bash
python manage.py setup_gamification
```
2. Verify API endpoint:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/api/auth/gamification/profile/me/
```

### Points not awarded
1. Check if activity is in `ACTIVITY_POINTS` mapping
2. Verify `award_points()` is called in the module
3. Check backend logs for errors

### Level not updating
- Levels update automatically when points threshold is reached
- Check `UserCivicProfile.update_level()` is working
- Verify level thresholds in database

### Redemption failing
1. Check if user has enough credits
2. Verify benefit type is valid
3. Check for active redemptions (only 5 active at a time)

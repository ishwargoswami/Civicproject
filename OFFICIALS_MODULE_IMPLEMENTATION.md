---

## 🎨 **Frontend Implementation**

### **Redux State Structure**

```typescript
interface OfficialsState {
  dashboardStats: DashboardStats | null;
  assignedIssues: Issue[];
  urgentIssues: Issue[];
  unassignedIssues: Issue[];
  departmentProjects: DepartmentProject[];
  performanceMetrics: PerformanceMetric | null;
  recentActivities: Activity[];
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  lastUpdated: string | null;
}
```

### **Redux Actions (Async Thunks)**

1. **`fetchDashboardStats()`** - Fetches dashboard statistics
2. **`fetchAssignedIssues(params)`** - Fetches issues assigned to official
3. **`fetchUrgentIssues()`** - Fetches high-priority urgent issues
4. **`fetchUnassignedIssues(params)`** - Fetches unassigned issues
5. **`assignIssue({ issueId, assigneeId })`** - Assigns an issue
6. **`updateIssuePriority({ issueId, priority })`** - Updates issue priority
7. **`fetchDepartmentProjects(params)`** - Fetches department projects
8. **`fetchPerformanceMetrics()`** - Fetches performance metrics
9. **`fetchRecentActivities()`** - Fetches recent activities

### **API Service Methods**

The `officialsAPI` service provides clean methods for all endpoints:

```typescript
import officialsAPI from '@/services/officialsApi';

// Dashboard stats
const stats = await officialsAPI.getDashboardStats();

// Assigned issues with filters
const issues = await officialsAPI.getAssignedIssues({
  priority: 'high',
  status: 'open',
  urgent: true
});

// Assign issue
await officialsAPI.assignIssue(issueId, assigneeId);

// Update priority
await officialsAPI.updateIssuePriority(issueId, 'critical');
```

## 🔄 **Data Flow**

### **1. Component Mount:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  dispatch(fetchDashboardStats());
  dispatch(fetchUrgentIssues());
  dispatch(fetchDepartmentProjects());
  dispatch(fetchPerformanceMetrics());
}, [dispatch]);
```

### **2. Auto-Refresh (Every 5 minutes):**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    dispatch(fetchDashboardStats());
    dispatch(fetchUrgentIssues());
  }, 300000); // 5 minutes
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [dispatch]);
```

### **3. Manual Refresh:**
```typescript
const handleRefresh = () => {
  dispatch(fetchDashboardStats());
  dispatch(fetchUrgentIssues());
  dispatch(fetchDepartmentProjects());
  dispatch(fetchPerformanceMetrics());
};
```

---

## 🔐 **Security & Permissions**

### **Backend Permission Class:**
```python
class IsOfficialOrAdmin(permissions.BasePermission):
    """Custom permission to only allow officials and admins"""
    
    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        return request.user.is_authenticated and request.user.role in ['official', 'admin']
```

All official endpoints are protected with this permission class, ensuring only authenticated users with the `official` or `admin` role can access them.

### **Frontend Route Protection:**
```typescript
if (!user || user.role !== 'official') {
  return <Navigate to="/unauthorized" replace />;
}
```

---

## 📈 **Database Queries**

### **Optimized Queries:**
All views use Django ORM's `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()` for optimized database queries:

```python
issues = Issue.objects.filter(assigned_to=user).select_related(
    'category', 'reported_by'
).prefetch_related('images')
```

### **Aggregations:**
Statistics use Django's aggregation functions:
```python
from django.db.models import Count, Sum, Avg

stats = {
    'total': issues.count(),
    'high_priority': issues.filter(priority='high').count(),
    'by_status': {
        'open': issues.filter(status='open').count(),
        # ...
    }
}
```

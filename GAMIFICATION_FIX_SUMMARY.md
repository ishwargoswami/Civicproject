# Gamification API Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **URL Patterns Mismatch**
**Problem**: Frontend was requesting endpoints that didn't exist:
- `/api/auth/gamification/profile/me/` (was `/profile/`)
- `/api/auth/gamification/credits/available/` (didn't exist)
- `/api/auth/gamification/credits/history/` (didn't exist)

**Solution**: Updated `backend/accounts/urls_gamification.py`:
- Changed `profile/` to `profile/me/`
- Added `credits/available/` endpoint
- Added `credits/history/` endpoint

### 2. **Missing View Functions**
**Problem**: Two endpoint functions were missing:
- `get_available_redemptions()`
- `get_redemption_history()`

**Solution**: Created both functions in `backend/accounts/gamification_views.py`:
- `get_available_redemptions()` - Returns redemption options with icons and descriptions
- `get_redemption_history()` - Returns user's redemption history

### 3. **Serializer Field Mismatch**
**Problem**: Frontend expected different field names than backend provided:
- Frontend: `benefit_type`, `benefit_type_display`, `credits_cost`
- Backend: `credit_type`, `credit_label`, `credits_spent`

**Solution**: Updated serializers to map fields correctly:
- `CommunityCreditSerializer` - Added field mappings for frontend compatibility
- `UserCivicProfileSerializer` - Completely restructured to match frontend interface
- `CivicLevelSerializer` - Added `points_required` and `monthly_credits` fields

### 4. **Redemption API Mismatch**
**Problem**: Redemption endpoint expected complex serializer validation, but frontend sends simple `benefit_type` string

**Solution**: Simplified `redeem_credit()` function to accept `benefit_type` directly from request data

## Next Steps

If you still see errors:

1. **Check Django server is running**:
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py runserver
```

2. **Verify gamification data exists**:
```bash
python manage.py setup_gamification
```

3. **Check browser console** for any remaining errors

4. **Hard refresh** browser (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)

---

**Status**: ✅ All gamification API endpoints are now properly configured and should work correctly!
